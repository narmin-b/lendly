- **ViewModels**: State management (`RoadmapViewModel`)

### State Management
- `@State` for local view state
- `@StateObject` / `@ObservedObject` for shared state
- `@Published` properties for reactive updates

### Key Components
- **Custom Shapes**: `BubbleShape` for tooltips
- **Patterns**: `DiagonalStripePattern`, `DottedPattern`, `MeshGradientBackground`
- **Charts**: Swift Charts with iOS 15 fallback

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Integration
The AI Coach feature requires backend API configuration. Update the API endpoint in `CoachView.swift`:

```swift
private let apiURL = "your-api-endpoint"
```

### Color Customization
Modify colors in `Utilities/AppColors.swift` to match your brand.

## 📝 Notes

- The app uses a dark theme throughout
- Level 1 and 2 are pre-completed by default
- Level 3 is the active level with 30% progress
- Levels beyond 3 are locked until previous levels are completed
- Financial offers unlock based on level completion
